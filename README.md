Project Description: Pomo-Do Task Manager

Overview:
Pomo-Do is a task management web application that combines task creation and management with the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Features:
Task Creation: Users can create new tasks by providing a title and description through a user-friendly form.

Task Listing: Existing tasks are displayed on the homepage, allowing users to view and manage them easily.

Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks individually, removing them from the system as needed.

Task Details: Clicking on a task reveals its detailed content, including the title and description, in a separate page.

Task updation : You can edit the task anytime after creating it and it will be saved again.

Pomodoro Timer: Pomo-Do incorporates a Pomodoro timer feature, displaying a countdown timer set to the default 25-minute Pomodoro interval. Users can start, stop, reset, and resume the timer as needed.
